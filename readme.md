## Introduction

This project is named "Hoori" which refers to the japanese god Hoori who was the god of grain and rice. The reason for this is that the site will collect recipes with the intent to break them down to their core which is the reason that the macros are included. Further, it will give a helping hand in the style direction of the user interface, that will aim to be sleek and minimalistic.
